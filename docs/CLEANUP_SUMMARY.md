# Code Cleanup Summary - July 31, 2025

## Removed Unused Components

### Backend Services
- `server/services/similarity-service.ts` - Complex similarity analysis service (unused)
- `server/services/janusgraph-similarity.ts` - JanusGraph-specific similarity analysis (unused)
- `server/storage/graphql-storage.ts` - GraphQL storage implementation (unused)
- `server/services/graphql-client.ts` - GraphQL client service (unused)
- `server/api/health.ts` - Standalone health check module (unused)

### Frontend Components
- `client/src/components/mini-assistant.tsx` - Mini AI assistant component (unused)

## Simplified Components

### Non-AI Chat Service
- Simplified `server/services/non-ai-chat.ts` from 600+ lines to 190 lines
- Removed complex similarity, impact, and dependency analysis
- Kept only basic system information queries:
  - System status and health
  - Source information and counts
  - Help commands
  - Transaction and bulletin counts

### OpenAI Service
- Removed unused similarity service imports
- Cleaned up constructor and initialization methods
- Simplified service dependencies

### Storage Factory
- Removed GraphQL storage references
- Cleaned up imports and initialization logic

## Fixed Issues

### TypeScript Diagnostics
- Resolved all 14 LSP diagnostics across multiple files
- Fixed import errors from deleted services
- Corrected type mismatches in API routes

### Data Type Issues
- Fixed PostgreSQL count queries returning strings instead of numbers
- Updated knowledge retention service to return proper numeric types
- Ensured all statistics APIs return consistent number types

## Current Service Architecture

### Active Services
- `janusgraph.ts` - Main JanusGraph connection and query service
- `janusgraph-query.ts` - Query execution and result processing
- `knowledge-retention.ts` - Government-level knowledge storage
- `non-ai-chat.ts` - Simplified system information service
- `openai.ts` - AI chat completion service

### Storage Implementation
- `storage.ts` - In-memory storage implementation (MemStorage)
- `database-storage.ts` - PostgreSQL storage (available but unused)
- `storage-factory.ts` - Storage selection and initialization

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed 5 unused service files totaling ~2000 lines of code
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Simplified service dependencies and imports
3. **Better Performance**: Eliminated unused service instantiation and dependencies
4. **Type Safety**: Resolved all TypeScript errors and warnings
5. **Clear Architecture**: Focused on actually used components and services

## Knowledge Page Status

All knowledge page functionality confirmed working:
- ✅ Add Entry: POST /api/knowledge working properly
- ✅ Search: GET /api/knowledge/search with proper filtering
- ✅ Node Relationships: POST /api/knowledge/node-relationship working
- ✅ Analytics: GET /api/knowledge/stats returning proper numbers
- ✅ Statistics display correct data types in frontend

## Next Steps

The system is now clean, focused, and ready for production use with all unused code removed and documentation updated.
