- [ ] External work item APIs accessible (if configured)
- [ ] All API endpoints return expected responses

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Response times acceptable (< 2 seconds for most requests)
- [ ] Memory usage within expected limits
- [ ] CPU usage normal
- [ ] Log files created and rotating properly
- [ ] Monitoring endpoints accessible

### User Experience

- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive data

### Data Security
- [ ] Database connections encrypted
- [ ] API keys secured in environment variables
- [ ] Chat data properly isolated (memory-only storage)
- [ ] Audit trails functional (if government-level features enabled)

## Rollback Plan

### Preparation
- [ ] Previous working version tagged in Git
- [ ] Database backup created before deployment
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested

### Rollback Steps (if needed)
1. [ ] Stop current application
2. [ ] Restore previous application version
3. [ ] Restore database if schema changes were made
4. [ ] Restart application and verify functionality
5. [ ] Update DNS/load balancer if necessary

## Monitoring Setup
